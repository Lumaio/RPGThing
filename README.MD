RPG THING
==========
This is an rpg thing I made that has no name as of yet.

How it works
============
It works by reading what is essentially an array of integers. Each integer is type of block, for instance '1' is wall block, while '0' is an air block. 2 is a door and 3 is an open door. The game then checks the integers and draws accordingly.
